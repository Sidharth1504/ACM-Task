# Report Summary:

## Approach:
In this project, a deep learning model is developed to classify images as containing Pepe the Frog or not. The dataset used for training consists 
of synthetic images containing Pepe. The task is approached by preprocessing the dataset, building a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture 
for image classification, training the model on the training set, and evaluating its performance on the testing set.

## Architecture Design:
The model architecture is a sequential CNN consisting of convolutional layers with ReLU activation, followed by max-pooling layers for downsampling.
The final layers include fully connected dense layers with ReLU activation, culminating in a single output neuron with sigmoid activation for binary
classification. The model is compiled with the Adam optimizer and binary cross-entropy loss.

## Training Process:
The dataset is split into training, validation, and testing sets using a stratified split. The model is trained for 10 epochs with a batch size of 
32 . Training progress and validation accuracy are monitored using the validation set.

## Evaluation Results:
The trained model achieved a test accuracy of 51%. A classification report is generated, providing metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score
for both classes ('Non-Pepe' and 'Pepe'). The classification report indicates the model's performance on distinguishing between Pepe and non-Pepe 
images.

## Conclusion:
Overall, the model demonstrates reasonable performance in classifying images containing Pepe the Frog. Further experimentation with different 
architectures, hyperparameters, or data augmentation techniques may improve performance. Additionally, incorporating a larger and more diverse 
dataset could enhance the model's ability to generalize to unseen data.
